Lucas wakes up from the short nap.

Head downstairs and talk to Mayor Geoff.

Lucas. The earthquake we witnessed was no regular one I believe that it was caused by the Scientists.
That was probably one of their experiments gone wrong but if I am correct then that means they are continuing to develop those weapons.
We need to stop them from doing that! Otherwise...otherwise they might recreate the events those years ago, and while their intentions
might be just its costing them the Earth and the human population.

I need you to find the person who is leading them you will most likely get the information you need from the captains.
But be careful they harness what we call 'New Age' weapons and they're devastating. Please, do this for not only us but for everyone on Earth.
I wish you luck and remember if you need any help everyone here in the Hub will do our best to aid you.
