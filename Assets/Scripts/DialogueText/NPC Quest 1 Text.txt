Ah, Lucas! There you are! I'm sure you heard that rumbling noise.
Honestly I have no idea as to what may have caused that... we have been talking and -... actually never mind that.
I need you to go find Mark he should be outside. He will tell you what you need to do.
By the way, if you ever need helpful tips everyone inside here should be willing to help.

Lucas! Lucas! I need you to head over to the Forest of Wolves.
It sounded as if the source of the sound came from over there.
But be careful, okay?
It is very dangerous there.
