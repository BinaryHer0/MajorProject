There are two types of Sign Posts that you will encounter to interact with them press either the 'Enter' or 'E' key.
The first type is the Generic type which will give you helpful tips/information while the second type are the Danger types.
These types will notify you that you will be running into a random encounter field, so be careful.
If you want other tips talk to the others.
