Lucas I hope you remember about items!
...
You don't...?
Sigh... Okay well there are two ways that you can gain items.
First is fighting monsters. When you win a battle there is a chance that it will drop loot but it will always drop gold.
You can use that gold for the second method which is to visit the 'Blacksmith' shop. Talking to either Noah or John you can
buy/sell weapons, armours and misc. items. If you want other tips talk to the others.
