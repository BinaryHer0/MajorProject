Head back to the Central Hub and report your findings to Mayor Geoff.

Lucas! Are you okay!?

I see... It seems they have made their move. You should head to Alice over by the Inn if you need to patch yourself up
otherwise you can head over to Noah and John to see if you have enough to buy some new equipment. When you're ready go back to your room
and rest, I will tell you what you need to know later.
